## Note
### What's One-Repetition Maximum(1RM) ?
One-Repetition Maximum is the heaviest weight that a person can lift only once with the person's full strength.
It can be measured by calculating from weight and reqetitions.
For example, in the case of Bench Press, if you can lift 40kg weight 10 times, you can also lift 50kg weight only once.
In this case, your 1RM is 50kg.
Although there are some formulas to measure 1RM, O'Conner's formula is adopted in this package.

Moreover, 1RM is used in considering training menus.
This package lets you know recommended training menus based on your 1RM.

### What's the BIG 3 ?
BIG3 is the common name of three major exercises which are Bench Press, Squat and Dead Lift.
